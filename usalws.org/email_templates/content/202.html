 Dear&nbsp;#CLIENT_FULL_NAME#&nbsp;,<br>
<br>
In order to complete and submit your application, please attach a copy of your passport & address proof (any utility bill, water, electricity or gas bill) along with your photo as per the below instruction.
<br><br>
We recommend you use a professional visa photo service to ensure your photo meets all the requirements. 
<br><br>
<b>Your photo is a vital part of your visa application. Carefully follow the instructions below</b>
<br><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the photo presents the full head from the top of the hair to the bottom of the chin</li>
<li>Center the head with the frame</li>
<li>The person in the photo should have a neutral expression and be facing the camera</li>
 <img style="     margin: 0 33% 0;   height: 200px;display:inline-flex;" alt="directions.png" src="https://usalws.org/upload/medialibrary/7c6/unnamed.gif">
<li>The top of the head, including the hair, to the bottom of the chin must be between 50% and 69% of  
        the image's total height. The eye height (measured from the bottom of the image to the level of the
        eyes) should be between 56% and 69% of the image's height.
</li>
<li>Image pixel dimensions must be in a square aspect ratio (meaning the height must be equal to the

       acceptable dimensions are 1200 pixels (width) x 1200 pixels (height).
